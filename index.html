        <p style="color: aqua;">R.velmanikam (rap specialist) The Lord of the Rings—an overtly Biblical epic that seemingly takes place in the Middle Ages—made little room for nuance between good and evil. Orcs and Trolls and Sauron—these are absolute monsters with no redeeming values. “Tolkien was very clear about his monsters being intended as embodiments of pure malice and corruption, with no effort made to show any humanizing or empathetic aspects to them,” writes Fox.

            The trap is to think of all literary and mythical monsters in these Biblical terms. Though God and Tolkien may have had certain ideas about evil… well, #NotAllMonsters. To look at even the most classic of fictional monsters is to see complications to this reductive version of evil. Grendel, for instance, the villain of the Old English epic poem Beowulf, might seem a clear-cut brute. He’s depicted as a giant and is said to be a descendent of Cain, from the Book of Genesis, adding to his essential evilness.</p>

Despite her engaging performance, a cloud of concern has been cast by an allegation that Ahyeon used a racial slur during her act. Observant viewers alleged that they distinctly heard her use the n-word, which sparked a significant backlash amongst fans.</p>

<p style="color: blueviolet;">From an underdeveloped story to an underwhelming werewolf design, there are a few reasons why Wolf Man has been getting such mixed reviews from critics. Wolf Man is director Leigh Whannell’s second reimagining of a Universal Monsters classic after his retooling of The Invisible Man, released in 2020. The new version of Wolf Man stars Christopher Abbott and Julia Garner as a married couple, Blake and Charlotte Lovell, who drive up to a spooky farm in Oregon to gather the husband’s late father’s things and contend with a local werewolf.
